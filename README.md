# Recover

Imagine several photos were saved on a digital camera as JPEGs on a memory card and those have deleted somehow. Thankfully, in the computer world, "deleted" tends not to mean "deleted" so much as "forgotten." Even though the camera insists that the card is now blank, we’re pretty sure that’s not quite true. This program recovers those photos.

### Usage

    $ g++ recover.c -o recover.out

> Run this command to compile.

    ./recover.out card.raw

> Run this command to execute the program
